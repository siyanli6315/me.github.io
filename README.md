### 1.1 [*Great Again or Stronger Together? Sentiment Analysis About Book Reviews on Amazon*](https://github.com/jw-cufe/SentimentAnalysisAboutBookReview)

During the presidential election in the year of 2016, Donald Trump, a fruitful writer, businessman and talk show host, swept adverse remarks away and flushed to the top against his rival, Hillary Clinton, as the 45th American president. This research collected book reviews of both candidates' bestsellers on Amazon during US presidential election, then used VADER(Valence Aware Dictionary for sentiment Reasoning) to extract emotional changes in book reviews of 2 bestsellers by the two presidential candidates before, during and after the election. We found 3 major conclusions listed above: First, all the major events, whether positive or negative, will cause an increase in the number of book reviews(representing public attention) by person concerned. Second, although Americans are sensitive to political scandals, the influence of candidates' political debate performance could overwhelm sudden events. Third, most American readers would use humor or irony to express their appreciation or dissatisfaction with certain political events, so that online scoring could not reflect public opinion precisely.
